Hi 👋🏻, my name is Sandro Sousa, I'm a web developer. In this repository you will be able to see some simple mini projects I did while studying ReactJS.

I created this mini project using Vite, is from a series of tutorials I'm following in order to get the hang of ReactJS and be able to start building responsive, animated and reusable web components for my future projects.

In this case it is a Search bar that lets you search a list of car brands, animals and country names segmenting all those items in separate categories.

You can find me on LinkedIn following this link 👉🏻 https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandrosousarivera/

CHEERS!!
